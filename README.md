# About DBRE_YDS repo 

I am an expert Oracle DBA and vert proud of my excellent database problem solving skills. I have been mindfulness about SRE/DBRE principles and passionate in developing programing skills and applying software approaches to improve productivties of fellow DBAs and enhance experiences of developers who require database team support.   

This repo contains various projects, programs and scripts I developed from my DBA/SRE work or as results of learning-by-doing projects. 

This repo is public sharable. I have made efforts as much as possible to hide or mask any real server and database names or employer related infomation.
