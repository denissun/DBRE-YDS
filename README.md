# About DBRE_YDS repo 

I am an expert Oracle DBA and proud of my database problem solving skills. I have been mindfulness in SRE/DBRE priciples and passionate in developing programing skills and applying software approaches to solve operational problems and chellenges.  

This repo contains various projects, programs and scripts I developed from my DBA/SRE work or as results of learning-by-doing projects. 

This repo is public sharable. I have made efforts as much as possible to hide or mask any real server and database names or employer related infomation.
